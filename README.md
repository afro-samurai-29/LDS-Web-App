## Guidelines
* All files and subdirectries contained in [src](src/) should only be edited from within `feature/ui` branch.
* All files and subdirectries contained in [PHP](php/) should only be edited from within `feature/php` branch.
* All merges/commits into the `main` branch must quickly be followed by all other branches rebasing from main. All other contributers must also be informed to pull, handle conflicts, and push again, then the cycle of merging and rebasing is done again until no further conflicts emerge.
