    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
      We are four <span class="highlight">Computer Science students from Wits University</span> who noticed a challenge many overlook. While bursaries and funding schemes help thousands of students get into varsity, a forgotten group remains—those who, after failing a module or two, can still register but lose access to bursaries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without financial support, many of these students struggle to afford the basic essentials every student deserves.
    </p>
    <p>
      This platform was created so that <span class="highlight">students can come together to donate and help this forgotten group regain their dignity.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      We believe that through small acts of kindness and solidarity, we can make a big difference—ensuring that no student is left behind simply because of financial hardship.
